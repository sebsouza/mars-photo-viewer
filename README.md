- Obtains photos from the 'Mars Rover' endpoint
- Allows the user to see the photos of each rover (Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit)
- The photos list should be paginated showing a max of 25 photos per page (dynamic loading similar to facebook/instagram will be nice, but not required)
- Allows the user to filter the rover photos by camera
- By default it shows the latest photos for current day
- Allows the user to search for photos based on 'Earth Day' date (2020-09-22)
